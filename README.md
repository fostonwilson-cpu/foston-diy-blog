# Foston DIY Blog

A refreshed static site for Foston's do-it-yourself home repair hub. The redesign introduces:

- A hero header with clear navigation and dark-mode toggle persistence
- Rich featured project details, planning resources, and a newsletter call-to-action
- A fully styled tips archive with deep-linked categories and quick-share legends
- A new about page highlighting Foston's story, favorite tools, and collaboration options
- Additional planner, resource shelf, and community spotlight sections on the homepage
